:::caution Deno KV is currently in beta

Deno KV is currently **experimental** and **subject to change**. While we do our
best to ensure data durability, data loss is possible, especially around Deno
updates.

Executing Deno programs that use KV currently requires the `--unstable` flag, as
below:

```sh
deno run -A --unstable my_kv_code.ts
```
