# Deno Deploy Quick Start

Deno Deploy is a globally distributed platform for serverless JavaScript
applications. Your JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly code runs on managed
servers geographically close to your users, enabling low latency and faster
response times. Deploy applications run on fast, light-weight
[V8 isolates](https://deno.com/blog/anatomy-isolate-cloud) rather than virtual
machines, powered by the [Deno runtime](/runtime/manual).

Let's deploy your first application - it should only take a few minutes.

## <a name="existingproject"></a>Deploy your existing project 

Import a project and run it on the edge it with Deno Deploy. 

1. [From the Deno Deploy dashboard](https://dash.deno.com) click the "New Project" button.

2. Connect to your GitHub account and select the repository you would like to deploy.
Follow the on-screen instructions to deploy your existing application.

3. Complete the Project Configuration form. This will create a GitHub action to deploy your project. Give your project a name and select from the optional framework presets. If you are not using a framework, you can set up your build settings using the form.

4. Confirm that your build options are correct and click the "Deploy Project" button to kick off your new Github action and deploy your project.

In a few moments, your Hello World server will be deployed across ~30 data 
centers around the world, ready to handle large volumes of traffic.

Once your deployment is successful you can visit your newly deployed project at the url provided on the success page or manage it in your dashboard.

## Option 2: Start from scratch

If you'd like to develop and deploy a simple application, follow these
instructions to get started. 

We'll use the [`deployctl`](./deployctl.md) command
line utility to deploy a local Deno script from your computer.

### Install Deno and `deployctl`

If you haven't already, you can 
[install the Deno runtime](/runtime/manual/getting_started/installation) 
using one of the commands below:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs'; import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS" default>

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem  value="windows" label="Windows">

```powershell
irm https://deno.land/install.ps1 | iex
```

</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">

```sh
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

After Deno is installed, install the [`deployctl`](./deployctl.md) utility:

```
deno install -A --no-check -r -f https://deno.land/x/deploy/deployctl.ts
```

You can confirm `deployctl` has been installed correctly by running:

```
deployctl --help
```

Now, you're ready to deploy a Deno script from the command line!

### Write and test a Deno program

Create a file called `server.ts` in your terminal, and include the following
"Hello World" web server:

```ts title="server.ts"
Deno.serve(() => new Response("Hello, world!"));
```

You can test that it works by running it with the command below:

```
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

Your server should be viewable at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). 

[Add this new project to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github) and follow the [guide to deploy your project with Deno Deploy](#existingproject).

## Option 3: Start with a playground

A [playground](./playgrounds.md) is a browser-based editor that enables you to
write and run JavaScript code right away. This is a great choice for just
kicking the tires on Deno and Deno Deploy!
[From the Deno Deploy dashboard](https://dash.deno.com), click the "New Project"
button and choose any of the options with a "Try with a playground" button.

## Next Steps

Now that you've created your first project, you can 
[check out the kinds of apps](./use-cases.md) you can run on Deploy. You could 
also skip right to [setting up your own custom domain](./custom-domains.md).
We're so excited to see what you'll ship with Deploy!
