# Organizations

[**Organizations**](https://apidocs.deno.com/#get-/organizations/-organizationId-)
are a container for all data related to a subhosting implementation. Your
organization will have a name and an ID. Each organization has an analytics
endpoint which can be used to get metrics (such as request count and bandwidth
used) from across the organization.

Other Deploy users can be invited to collaborate on an organization, and
[access tokens](https://dash.deno.com/account#access-tokens) can give developers
with organization access the ability to modify resources within the org via API.
New organizations can be created in the
[Deploy dashboard](https://dash.deno.com/orgs/new).
